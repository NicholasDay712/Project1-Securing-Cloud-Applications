Project Method:

Developed and designed a cyber-blog web application using Azure’s Cloud services and Docker. Created and stored SSL certificates in Azure’s Key Vault, and bound them to secure the web application. Protected the web application by utilizing Azure’s Security features, such as the Azure WAF, and Security Center.


After the completion of the assignment, Azures free subscription subsided and therefore I added it to github so it can continue to be accessed through react.
